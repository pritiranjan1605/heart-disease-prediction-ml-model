# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical parameters. The dataset used contains information about patients' age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other relevant factors. 

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of medical records of individuals, with each record containing several attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other parameters, along with a target variable indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Model Training
The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a 80-20 ratio. Logistic Regression was chosen as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification tasks.

## Model Evaluation
The accuracy of the model was evaluated using both training and testing data. The accuracy score achieved on the testing data was approximately 85%.

## Predictive System
A predictive system was implemented to demonstrate the model's capability to predict heart disease based on input data. The system takes in a set of medical parameters as input and outputs whether the individual is likely to have heart disease or not.

## Instructions for Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`).
3. Run the provided Python script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
4. Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new data by passing the relevant medical parameters.

For more details, refer to the Jupyter Notebook file in the repository.

## Future Improvements
- Fine-tuning the model hyperparameters to potentially improve accuracy.
- Exploring other classification algorithms for comparison.
